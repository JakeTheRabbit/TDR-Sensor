## Overview

This project provides a complete ESPHome configuration for building a reliable Wi-Fi‚Äìenabled SDI-12 sensor node.
It runs on an M5Stack Atom Lite (ESP32) and reads soilless-media moisture sensors such as the Infiwin MT22 (a Teros-12-compatible clone).

It is tuned specifically for rockwool, coco, and peat substrates, performing on-device calibration and physics-based corrections to produce:

* Volumetric Water Content (VWC) using a polynomial calibration
* Pore Water Electrical Conductivity (pwEC) using a hybrid Hilhorst and mass-balance model
* Temperature-normalized EC (25 ¬∞C) for consistent comparison

---

## Disclaimer

* This configuration is provided as-is and is experimental.
* Validate readings against reference instruments before operational use.
* Always calibrate sensors in your specific substrate and nutrient range.

| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ESP32 Board | [M5Stack Atom Lite](https://shop.m5stack.com/products/atom-lite-esp32-development-kit) (tested also on Atom S3, PoE ESP32, M5 Dial) |
| Sensor      | Infiwin MT22 (SDI-12 version), METER TEROS-12, Growlink Terralink series                                                            |
| Power       | 5 V (typical) or 3.3 V depending on board and sensor                                                                                |
| Wiring      | Standard 3-wire SDI-12 connection                                                                                                   |

### Wiring Table

| SDI-12 Sensor | M5 Atom Pin | Description                |
| ------------- | ----------- | -------------------------- |
| Data          | G26         | SDI-12 half-duplex line    |
| Power (VCC)   | 5 V / 3.3 V | Match sensor specification |
| Ground        | GND         | Common ground              |

The SDI-12 ‚Äúdata‚Äù line is half-duplex: TX and RX share GPIO 26 and use inverted signaling as per SDI-12 protocol.

## Installation

1. **ESPHome Environment** ‚Äì Install ESPHome via the Home Assistant add-on or standalone CLI.
2. **Secrets File** ‚Äì Create `secrets.yaml` for network credentials:

   ```yaml
   wifi_ssid: "YourWiFi_SSID"
   wifi_password: "YourWiFi_Password"
   ```
3. **Flash the Device**

   * Copy the YAML (`f1-row2-front-sdi12.yaml`) into your ESPHome folder.
   * Update `api.encryption.key` and `ota.password` with unique secure values.
   * Connect the M5Stack Atom via USB ‚Üí Install.
   * Subsequent updates can be performed Over-The-Air (OTA).

## Sensor Logic and Calibration

### Volumetric Water Content (VWC)

```cpp
float R = id(mt22_raw).state;
float theta = 6.771e-10*R*R*R - 5.105e-6*R*R + 1.302e-2*R - 10.848;
float pct = theta * 100.0f;
```

* Polynomial derived from the Teros-12 ‚Äúsoilless‚Äù calibration, valid across rockwool, coco, and peat.
* Result clamped between 0‚Äì100%.
* Adjust offset or scale to align with reference instruments if needed.

---

### Pore Water Electrical Conductivity (pwEC)

Standard sensors report **Bulk EC (œÉb)**‚Äîthe combined conductivity of solids, water, and air.
The **Pore Water EC (œÉp)** isolates the salinity of the water actually available to plant roots.

This configuration implements a hybrid model:

```cpp
// mass-balance fallback (dry media)
ec_mass = œÉb / Œ∏;

// Hilhorst model (wet media)
ec_hil = œÉb * (Œµp25 / (Œµb ‚Äì Œµ0));

// dynamic blending
if Œ∏ ‚â§ 0.40 ‚Üí use mass-balance
if Œ∏ ‚â• 0.60 ‚Üí use Hilhorst
blend linearly in between
```

**Result:**
Stable EC readings across all moisture levels, eliminating NaN and 50+ dS/m spikes that occur in dry media.

Expected range in rockwool: 4‚Äì6 dS/m under typical feed EC 2.0‚Äì3.0 dS/m.

---

### Temperature Normalization

Electrical conductivity increases by approximately 1.9% per ¬∞C above 25¬∞C.
The bulk EC is normalized to 25¬∞C internally:

```cpp
œÉb25 = œÉb / (1.0 + 0.019 * (T - 25.0));
```

## Substrate Calibration Notes

| Substrate    | Typical Range (VWC) | Notes                                       |
| ------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Rockwool     | 0.20 ‚Äì 0.80         | Default polynomial performs best            |
| Coco Coir    | 0.15 ‚Äì 0.75         | Slightly higher bound water; add +5% offset |
| Peat         | 0.10 ‚Äì 0.65         | Reads higher Œµb; subtract ~3% VWC           |
| Mineral Soil | 0.00 ‚Äì 0.60         | Use Teros-12 ‚Äúsoil‚Äù polynomial instead      |

A `select:` block can be added in ESPHome to switch between these calibrations.

Would you like me to add a short ‚ÄúCalibration Workflow‚Äù section explaining how to collect true VWC/EC data to create new polynomials for other substrates? It would complete the documentation set for research or professional growers.
